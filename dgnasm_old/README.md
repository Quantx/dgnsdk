# dgnasm
dgnasm - Data General Nova Assembler

This was created from scratch using original documentation as reference.
The first working version was completed after three days of non-stop work.

To install, simply clone or download the repository run `make` followed by `make symbols`. Then run `dgnasm` to assemble your project.

A complete user and programming reference guide for the Data General Nova can be found [here](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dg/DG_NM-5_How_To_Use_The_Nova_Computers_Apr1971.pdf)
